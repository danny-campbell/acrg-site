Tobias BÃ¶rger is a lecturer in economics at the Economics Division of the University of Stirling. His research is in applied environmental economics with a focus on the application and development of environmental valuation methods. He uses discrete choice experiments, contingent valuation, the travel cost method and subjective wellbeing approaches to value non-market environmental benefits and ecosystem services. Tobias has used environmental valuation in a number of developed and developing countries across Europe and Asia. While the focus of his work has been on coastal and marine environments, he also applies environmental valuation in terrestrial settings, e.g. to quantify changes to flood risk or forest ecosystem services.
