Application of the natural capital approach requires a range of methods, which as yet have not been fully tested in the context of decision making for the marine environment. It is unlikely that existing methodologies, which were developed for terrestrial systems and are based on land cover assessment approaches, will ever be feasible in the marine context at the national scale. Land cover approaches are also fundamentally insufficient for the marine environment because they do not take account of the water column, the significant interconnections between spatially disparate components, or the highly dynamic nature of the marine ecosystem, for example the high spatial mobility of many species. Data gaps have been a significant impediment to progress, so alternative methods that use proxies for quality information as well as the opportunities for remote sensing should be explored further. Greater effort to develop methodologies specifically for the marine environment is required, which should be interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral, coherent across policy areas, and applicable across a range of contexts.","tags":["Natural capital approach","Decision making","Marine environment"],"title":"Applying the natural capital approach to decision making for the marine environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Tinch","Nicola Beaumont","Tim Sunderland","Ece Ozdemiroglu","David Barton","Colm Bowe","Tobias Borger","Paul Burgess","Canon Nigel Cooper","Michela Faccioli","Pierre Failler","Ioanna Gkolemi","Ritesh Kumar","Alberto Longo","Alistair McVittie","Joe Morris","Jacob Park","Neil Ravenscroft","Marije Schaafsma","James Vause","Guy Ziv"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560211200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560211200,"objectID":"3b88fc946a5ae579d26ee2c7a7422503","permalink":"/publication/jeep-2019/","publishdate":"2019-06-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jeep-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"There is increasing interest in the use of economic valuation of ecosystem goods and services for a wide variety of purposes. These include relatively familiar uses in project appraisal and more novel applications in advocacy, performance tracking and accounting in public and private settings. Decision makers who use valuation information need to understand the background, strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. The methods have a strong foundation in economic theory and offer a rapidly growing evidence base, improving ability to evaluate a broad range of ecosystem goods and services. Nevertheless, there are theoretical and practical limitations that need to be understood and kept in mind when interpreting results. In this paper, we briefly review the economic valuation methods and situate them in their historical and theoretical contexts. We assess the main critiques, attempts at resolving them, and implications for the usefulness of the methods in different contexts. We examine the main barriers and opportunities for wider uses of valuation evidence, and draw conclusions on the appropriate role of valuation in future, as a tool for aiding reflection and deliberation processes.","tags":["Economic valuation","Criticisms of economic valuation","Stated preference","Revealed preference","Externalities","Ecosystem services","Policy appraisal","Decision support"],"title":"Economic valuation of ecosystem goods and services: a review for decision makers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicola J.

However, despite the individual prominence of the Circular Economy and Sustainable Development in the academic and wider literature, the exact relationship between the two concepts has neither been thoroughly defined nor explored. The consequent result is various inconsistencies occurring across the literature regarding how the Circular Economy can serve as a tool for Sustainable Development and an incomplete understanding of how its long-term effects differ from those of the “linear” economy. A literature review was conducted to interpret the current conceptual relationship between the Circular Economy and Sustainable Development. The review highlights numerous challenges concerning conceptual definition, economic growth and implementation that inhibit the use of the Circular Economy as a tool for Sustainable Development in its current form. The review concludes by providing suggestions for how research concerning the Circular Economy should proceed if it is to provide a potential approach for achieving Sustainable Development.","tags":["Circular Economy","Sustainable Development","Linear economy","Social equity","Economic growth","Environmental degradation"],"title":"The Circular Economy: Swings and Roundabouts?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":[],"content":" from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

However, insufficient attention has been given to how best to address choice behaviours relating to this opt-out alternative when modelling discrete choice experiments, particularly in health studies. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how to account for different opt-out effects in choice models. We aim to contribute to a better understanding of how to model opt-out choices and show the consequences of addressing the effects in an incorrect fashion. We present our code written in the R statistical language so that others can explore these issues in their own data. In this practical guideline, we generate synthetic data on medication choice and use Monte Carlo simulation. We consider three different definitions for the opt-out alternative and four candidate models for each definition. We apply a frequentist-based multimodel inference approach and use performance indicators to assess the relative suitability of each candidate model in a range of settings. We show that misspecifying the opt-out effect has repercussions for marginal willingness to pay estimation and the forecasting of market shares. Our findings also suggest a number of key recommendations for DCE practitioners interested in exploring these issues. There is no unique best way to analyse data collected from discrete choice experiments. Researchers should consider several models so that the relative support for different hypotheses of opt-out effects can be explored.","tags":["Discrete choice experiments","Opt-out effects","Status-quo bias","R","Medication choice"],"title":"Including opt-out options in discrete choice experiments: Issues to consider","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianluca Grillia","Sandra Notaro","Danny Campbell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"8c8ef301af103ad07dc23c9c61cc0fa3","permalink":"/publication/ee-2018/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ee-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Value orientations towards wildlife affect the way people perceive nature and their connection with animals. In particular, the social psychological literature within the environmental field suggests that there are two main orientations of people towards wildlife: mutualism and domination. This body of literature has shown how wildlife value orientations can serve as predictors of attitudes and behaviours towards wildlife and form the foundation of human-wildlife conflicts. A common approach in the non-market valuation literature is to include information on attitudes and values in the deterministic part of the utility function, leading to problems of endogeneity bias. To avoid this, analysts have recently shifted their attention to approaches based on latent variables. This paper presents an application of a latent variable and latent class model, to understand how latent orientations influence choices, in a case study in the Italian Alps. The intuition is that different underlying individual value orientation affects preferences and the level of willingness to pay and should be therefore considered in choice models. The latent variable is used to explain class membership of respondents. Results indicate that the latent variable has a significant effect in class allocation and that the hybrid model performs better than a simple two class model. Results provide guidance on the social acceptability of management interventions and can support public decision-makers in the modulation of wildlife management policies for balancing the needs of conservation and outdoor recreation, explicitly considering existing human-wildlife conflicts.","tags":["Choice experiment","Hybrid model","Value orientation","Endangered species","Latent class model"],"title":"Including value orientations in choice models to estimate benefits of wildlife management policies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Caspar G.

The adequacy of eye tracking as a visual ANA measure might thus depend on the type of attribute. Further, the study unveiled inconsistencies in identifying non-attenders using visual ANA and the coefficient of variation.

We argue that this is a useful way of generating highly‐detailed spatial maps of willingness to pay for environmental conservation, given the costs of collecting data. The data used in this study come from a discrete choice experiment survey of public preferences for the implementation of a new national forest management and protection programme in Poland. We combine these with high‐resolution spatial data related to local forest characteristics. Using locally estimated discrete choice models we obtain location‐specific estimates of willingness to pay (WTP). Variation in these estimates is explained by characteristics of the forests close to where respondents live. These results are compared with those obtained from a more typical, two stage procedure which uses Bayesian posterior means of the mixed logit model random parameters to calculate location‐specific estimates of WTP. We find that there are indeed strong spatial patterns to the benefits of changes to the management to national forests. People living in areas with more species‐rich forests and those living nearer bigger areas of mixed forests have significantly different WTP values than those living in other locations. This kind of information potentially enables a better distributional analysis of the gains and losses from changes to natural resource management, and better targeting of investments in forest quality.","tags":["Contingent valuation","Discrete choice experiment","Forest management","Geographically weighted model","Litter","Local maximum likelihood","Mixed logit","Passive protection","Spatial heterogeneity of preferences","Tourist infrastructure","Weighted maximum likelihood","Willingness to pay"],"title":"Using geographically weighted choice models to account for the spatial heterogeneity of preferences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seda Erdem","Danny Campbell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"6848542447d08a61ab2e30dad737afe7","permalink":"/publication/ejhe-2017/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ejhe-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Stated preference elicitation techniques, such as discrete choice experiments and best-worst scaling, are now widely used in health research to explore the public’s choices and preferences. In this paper, we propose an alternative stated preference elicitation technique, which we refer to as ‘trio-wise’. We explain this new technique, its relative advantages, modeling framework, and how it compares to the best-worst scaling method. To better illustrate the differences and similarities, we utilize best-worst scaling Case 2, where individuals make best and worst (most and least) choices for the attribute levels that describe a single profile. We demonstrate this new preference elicitation technique using an empirical case study that explores preferences among the general public for ways to involve them in decisions concerning the health care system. Our findings show that the best-worst scaling and trio-wise preference elicitation techniques both retrieve similar preferences. However, the capability of our trio-wise method to provide additional information on the strength of rank preferences and its ability to accommodate indifferent preferences lead us to prefer it over the standard best-worst scaling technique.","tags":["Trio-wise","Best-worst scaling","Stated preference elicitation","Public health Public involvement"],"title":"Preferences for public involvement in health service decisions: A comparison between best-worst scaling and trio-wise stated preference elicitation techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mikołaj Czajkowski","Wiktor Budziński","Danny Campbell","Marek Giergiczny","Nick Hanley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509494400,"objectID":"ca8f7f46db23e6fba47232fabc7599b3","permalink":"/publication/ere_2017a/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ere_2017a/","section":"publication","summary":"The paper investigates the spatial heterogeneity of public's preferences for the implementation of a new country-wide forest management and protection program in Poland. Spatial econometric methods and high resolution geographical information system data related to forest characteristics are used to explain the variation in individual-specific willingness to pay (WTP) values, derived from a discrete choice experiment study. We find that respondents' WTP is higher the closer they live to their nearest forest, and the scarcer forests are in the area where they live. Interestingly, the higher the ecological value of forests in respondents' area, the more people prefer extending areas of national forest protection. We also investigate spatial patterns in individual-specific WTP scores and in latent class membership probabilities, finding that preferences are indeed spatially clustered. We argue that this clustering should be taken into account in forest management and policy-making.","tags":["Discrete choice experiment","Contingent valuation","Willingness to pay","Spatial heterogeneity of preferences","Forest management","Passive protection","Litter","Tourist infrastructure","Mixed logit","Kriging","Spatial-lag"],"title":"Spatial heterogeneity of willingness to pay for forest management","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Suzanne van Osch","Stephen Hynes","Tim O'Higgins","Nick Hanley","Danny Campbell","Shirra Freeman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506816000,"objectID":"db8031fd961d3d34a0eaf0f05e82a0f2","permalink":"/publication/mp-2017/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mp-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) has been put forward as a potential sustainable alternative to single fin fish species aquaculture. In IMTA, several species are combined in the production process. Integrating species has a conceivable dual advantage; the environmental impact can be lowered through nutrient cycling and from an economic perspective there is potential for increased efficiency, product diversification and a higher willingness to pay for more environmentally friendly produced salmon. This paper presents the results from a choice experiment which examines whether the Irish public is willing to pay a premium for “sustainably produced” farmed salmon from an IMTA process. Uniquely, an ecolabel was used in the design, based on familiar energy rating labels, to communicate the environmental pressure of fish farming to respondents. The experiment demonstrates that the Irish public has a willingness to pay a price premium for sustainability in salmon farming and for locally produced salmon.","tags":["Sustainable aquaculture","Choice experiments","Ecolabels","IMTA","Willingness to pay"],"title":"Estimating the Irish public's willingness to pay for more sustainable salmon produced by integrated multi-trophic aquaculture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erlend Dancke Sandorf","Danny Campbell","Nick Hanley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"dfd528ba5055d6eb23c74c04bab2b8b1","permalink":"/publication/jocm-2017/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jocm-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"We seek to disentangle the effect of knowledge about an environmental good on respondents' propensity to ignore one or more attributes on the choice cards in a discrete choice experiment eliciting people's preferences for increased protection of cold-water corals in Norway. We hypothesize that a respondent's level of knowledge influences the degree to which she ignores attributes. Respondents participated in a quiz on cold-water coral prior to the valuation task and we use the result of the quiz as an ex-ante measure of their knowledge. Our results suggests that a high level of knowledge, measured by a high quiz score, is associated with higher probabilities of attendance to the three non-cost attributes, although this effect is only significant for one of them. A higher quiz score is also associated with a significantly lower probability of attending to the cost attribute. Furthermore, although being told your score has mixed directional effects on attribute non-attendance, it does not significantly affect the probability of attending to any of the attributes. Finally, allowing for attribute non-attendance leads to substantially lower conditional willingness-to-pay estimates. This highlights the importance of measuring how much people know about the goods over which they are choosing, and underlines that more research is needed to understand how information influences the degree to which respondents ignore attributes.","tags":["Attribute non-attendance","Discrete choice experiment","Knowledge","Attribute processing strategies","Cold-water coral","Ecosystem services"],"title":"Disentangling the influence of knowledge on attribute non-attendance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danny Campbell","Morten Raun Mørkbak","Søren Bøye Olsen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498867200,"objectID":"4e9891df47dddffb7e263de0381d239f","permalink":"/publication/jeep-2017/","publishdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jeep-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we use paradata relating to the length of time respondents required in a self-administered online stated preference surveys. Although this issue has been previously explored, there is little guidance on how to identify and deal with ‘fast’ and ‘slow’ respondents. In this paper, we use scale-adjusted latent class models to address preference and variance heterogeneity and explore how class membership varies with response latency. To test our methodology, we use stated choice data collected via an online survey to establish German anglers’ preferences for fishing site attributes in Denmark. Results from our analysis corroborate that response latency has a bearing on the estimates of utility coefficients and the error variance. Although the results highlight the non-triviality of identifying fast and slow respondents, they signal the need to estimate a large number of candidate models to identify the most appropriate ‘fast’ and ‘slow’ thresholds. Not doing so is likely to lead to an inferior model and has repercussions for marginal willingness to pay estimates and choice predictions.","tags":["Angling recreation","Online surveys","Paradata","Response latency","Scale-adjusted latent class","Stated choice experiments"],"title":"Response time in online stated choice experiments: the non-triviality of identifying fast and slow respondents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Longo","Danny Campbell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496275200,"objectID":"a525d2deb099ca931c9b986120d4edd5","permalink":"/publication/ere_2017b/","publishdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ere_2017b/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper uses discrete choice models, supported by GIS data, to analyse the National Land Use Database, a register of more than 21,000 English brownfields—previously used sites with or without contamination that are currently unused or underused. Using spatial discrete choice models, including the first application of a spatial probit latent class model with class-specific neighbourhood effects, we find evidence of large local differences in the determinants of brownfields redevelopment in England and that the reuse decisions of adjacent sites affect the reuse of a site. We also find that sites with a history of industrial activities, large sites, and sites that are located in the poorest and bleakest areas of cities and regions of England are more difficult to redevelop. In particular, we find that the probability of reusing a brownfield increases by up to 8.5 % for a site privately owned compared to a site publicly owned and between 15 and 30 % if a site is located in London compared to the North West of England. We suggest that local tailored policies are more suitable than regional or national policies to boost the reuse of brownfield sites.","tags":["Brownfields","GIS","Revealed preferences","Binary choice model","Spatial autocorrelation","Spatial probit latent class model"],"title":"The determinants of brownfields redevelopment in England","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tobias Borger","Caroline Hattam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"d4719121c96ea5e60dafa8837b2794ae","permalink":"/publication/ee-2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ee-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Discrete choice experiments (DCE) are one of the main methods for the valuation of non-market environmental goods. However, concerns regarding the validity of choice responses obtained in such surveys remain, particularly in surveys dealing with environmental goods remote from and unfamiliar to respondents. This study assesses behavioural determinants of preferences for conservation benefits of a marine protected area on the Dogger Bank, a shallow sandbank in the southern North Sea in an attempt to assess construct validity of survey responses. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Norm Activation Model (NAM) are employed to empirically measure constructs that predict stated choices. The study finds that identified protest respondents score significantly lower on most TPB and NAM components than non-protesters. Results further show that components of both the TPB and the NAM robustly predict choice behaviour. The inclusion of the TPB components improves the predictive power of the estimation model more than the NAM components. In an additional latent class logit model, TPB and NAM components plausibly explain different patterns of WTP for conservation benefits of an offshore marine protected area. These findings support construct validity of stated choice data regarding the valuation of remote and unfamiliar environmental goods.","tags":["Environmental valuation","Discrete choice experiment","Theory of Planned behavior","Norm Activation Model","Latent class model","Error component model"],"title":"Motivations matter: Behavioural determinants of preferences for remote and unfamiliar environmental goods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Keila Meginnis","Danny Campbell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"60dfb44b67eae5f278254e41634f8985","permalink":"/publication/iree-2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iree-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study, we investigate Scottish postgraduate economics students’ preferences for module design.

We show how failing to address this leads to erroneous results and limits the ability to derive reliable prediction.
