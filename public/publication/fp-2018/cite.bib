abstract = "This paper investigates UK consumers’ trust in sixteen information sources, from government institutions to food handlers and media, to provide accurate information about the use of nanotechnology in food production and packaging. We elicit the perceived trust using a well-known choice-based stated preference technique, namely best-worst scaling. The results from the analysis of a scale-adjusted latent class model show considerable heterogeneity in consumers’ perceptions of trust and choice variability. The findings from this study provide insights into the development of best practices and policies in risk communication and management for novel foods produced by nanotechnologies. More specifically, they highlight how targeted approaches can be used by policymakers responsible for disseminating information relating to novel technologies."
