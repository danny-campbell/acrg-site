Valeria Toledo-Gallegos is a Research Fellow at the University of Stirling. Her current research uses discrete choice experiments to value preferences for environmental goods and services in both developed and developing countries. She is particularly interested in exploring ways to study environmental preferences while accounting for behavioural theories, as well as the cultural, spatial and temporal context. Other research interests are spatial analysis, non-market valuation, behavioural economics, environmental accounting and development studies. She holds a PhD from the University of St Andrews and studied an MSc in Environment and Sustainable Development at the University of Glasgow, UK. In Mexico, she completed a Specialist Degree in Economic Theory and a BSc in Environmental Sciences at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM).
